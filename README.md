NEW :

1.Upload a new mac pages, that is the tags what I want (the word.docx is actully old, so can delete it if you wish)
2.Provide my company logo to use on style
3.For the "YELLOW SIDEBAR ON FIRST PAGE", please make something similar, i dont have a copy of that. 






report_html.php 
-> A file that contains all the code of my usual report, extracted from microsoft word webpage html. I use this to get the css, and grasp the flow of the code.

style_record.php
-> File that the testing ground take place. Please Live preview it, press the download button, and you will see biggest problem : cannot translate Chinese. 

testing_$.php
-> File just to sotre a variable, test if variable can go through when going throguh HTML->PDF function.

other js file
-> File that contain the HTML -> PDF function code

Report example
-> Although I upload microsoft word, but when I do my report, I usually use Mac Pages. But I know it is easier to make this project by words. Also, The pdf is what I usually send to customer. So I want the end result to be like that, but skipping all the copy and paste, which I am doing everyday. Thats why I am building this.






Also, in general, is this a good way to do it?


General info :

(The report i sell is like horoscrope analysis report. If you are a gemini, i will pick "WORK number 1 content, "RELATIONSHIP number 5 content, "DESTINY number 2 content", "FRIENDSHIP numer 11 content" etc...and it all sum into a pdf report, and send out.)

(Im creating a webpage that connect to my localhost phpmyadmin. I will store a lot of content in db. And base on my client design, I will tick and select which content to put into the report through php tags.)

I am very new to coding, thats why I choose this way to do it just for simplicity, but at the same time willing to listen to professsion advice. But I just cannot solve the html -> pdf utf8 chinese character translation problem.
